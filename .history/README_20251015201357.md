# Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System

A simple and effective drowsiness detection system that monitors eye closure in real-time using computer vision.

## Features

- **Real-time Eye Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers
- **No Complex Dependencies**: Works with just OpenCV, NumPy, and Pygame
- **Audio Alert**: Plays alarm sound when drowsiness is detected
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows live video feed with eye detection rectangles and status

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: Detects faces using Haar Cascade classifier
2. **Eye Detection**: Identifies eyes within the face region
3. **Drowsiness Detection**: If eyes are not detected for consecutive frames (likely closed), triggers alarm
4. **Alert System**: Audio alarm and visual warning when drowsiness detected

## Installation

**Install Python dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! No additional files needed.

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python drowsiness.py
```

**Controls**:
- Press `q` to quit the application

## Parameters

You can adjust these parameters in the code:

- `EYE_CLOSED_FRAMES = 15`: Number of consecutive frames for drowsiness detection (lower = more sensitive)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Webcam
- Good lighting conditions
- Clear view of face

## Troubleshooting

**Error: Could not open webcam**
- Check if camera is connected
- Ensure no other application is using the camera

**Error: shape_predictor file not found**
- Download the predictor file as mentioned in installation steps

**Low detection accuracy**
- Improve lighting conditions
- Adjust camera position for clear face view
- Try adjusting `EAR_THRESHOLD` value

## Credits

Based on the Eye Aspect Ratio method for drowsiness detection.
